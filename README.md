# REViewer — Results Explorer & Viewer

UMAP-based visualization and analysis of chemical space generated by molecular generators (currently, only REINVENT 4 is supported, so the name can be interpreted also as REINVENT Explorer & Viewer).

## Features
This program is created for the visualisation of chemical space generated by molecular generators and the visual analysis of the generated scaffolds. It was initially developed to evaluate the areas of chemical space which are inside a combinatorial chemical space. However, one can run this program on any REINVENT output.     

The center panel is a 2D UMAP scatter plot representing the generated chemical space; points are colored by the selected property/score. The top bar provides a “Color by” selector and a range slider to restrict the displayed molecules to a chosen value interval. The left panel contains dataset filters and selection tools (lasso/rectangle), with an option to export selected points to CSV. When you hover over points, the corresponding molecular structures and metadata are displayed in the right-hand panel.
