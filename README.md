# REViewer — Results Explorer & Viewer

UMAP-based visualization and analysis of chemical space generated by molecular generators (currently, only REINVENT 4 is supported).

## Features
This program is created for the visualisation of chemical space generated by molecular generators and the visual analysis of the generated scaffolds. It was initially developed to evaluate the areas of chemical space which are inside a combinatorial chemical space. However, one can run this program on any REINVENT output.     

The main feature is the interactive analysis of the generated clusters, and picking and selection moleucles from the space.
